Kook is a smart build tool similar to Make, Rake, Ant, Scons, or Cook.

Kook is now implemented in several languages and these are separated into
individual branches. You should checkout branch what you want to get
as well as clone repository.

For example, if you want to get plKook (Perl) source code, try:

    $ git clone git://github.com/kwatch/kook.git
    $ cd kook/
    $ git branch -r
    origin/common
    origin/master
    origin/perl
    origin/python
    $ git checkout -b perl origin/perl
    $ git branch
      master
    * perl
